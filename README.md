# SRH image classification using ensemble of CLIP, EfficientNet and CatBoost models

This repository contains a ensemble classification of Siberian radioheliograph images that combines EfficientNet (CNN), CLIP (multimodal), and CatBoost (tabular) models.

## üß† Overview

The main components are:

- **`EffnetClassifier`**: Fine-tunes an EfficientNet model for image classification.
- **`ClipClassifier`**: Uses CLIP for zero-shot image classification.
- **`CatBoostTuner`**: Trains a gradient boosting model on extracted embeddings.
- **`EnsembleClassifier`**: Combines predictions from all three models into one final prediction.


Sure! Here's an updated version of your **README** section that includes using a **virtual environment (`venv`)** for better practice and isolation:

    abstract = {Accurate forecasting of upper atmospheric conditions can improve the efficiency of satellite operations and reduce the risks associated with the re-entry of large debris objects. Spacecrafts are affected by atmospheric drag which is strongly correlated with solar activity. One of the most important indices of solar activity is the F10.7 index. Recent studies have shown that F30 index demonstrates a more accurate proxy for solar extreme ultraviolet emission. This study presents a deep learning model for forecasting both indices. This model is a combination of the variational mode decomposition algorithm and the Time-series Dense Encoder neural network. The model is trained to forecast individual components of decomposed data given future and past covariates to improve understanding of trend and seasonality. Comparison with other models demonstrates an improvement in forecasting accuracy up to twofold for F10.7 index. The daily forecasting service was implemented online with predicting horizons of 7 and 27 days.}
